This shares a case study using the combination of test-driven design (TDD) and object-oriented programming (OOP) in Python coding projects. While both are individually great, in my opinion, there is insufficient discussion online and in tutorials about how to pragmatically use them together. There is tremendous synergy from this.

See tutorial.md for details.
